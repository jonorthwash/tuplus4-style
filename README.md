This is an unofficial LaTeX style file for the [Tu+4](https://wp.nyu.edu/tuworkshop4/) proceedings.

WARNING: this is a WORK IN PROGRESS.  See the [issues](https://github.com/jonorthwash/tuplus4-style/issues).

The style file is `tuplus4.sty`.  You can see how to use it in `example.tex`.

A few notes:
* It's set up to use `expex` for examples.
* It's set up to use `biblatex` (with `biber`) for the bibliography.
* It's set up to be compiled with `xelatex` for ease of use with arbitrary fonts and unicode.
* It's set up to use the FreeSerif font, which is very very similar to Times New Roman (and has good unicode and small-caps support).

If your preference is to use packages or fonts other than this, then there will need to be adjustments.
